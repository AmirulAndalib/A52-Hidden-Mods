# A52-Hidden-Mods

# ⚠️ - No support given anymore. I no longer have an A52 so will not be able to update this module. If you want to keep this project alive you can fork it and add your own updates, fixes etc.

Credit goes to the original creator UltraHQ [Github](https://github.com/UltraHQ) and Sloobot [Github](https://github.com/Sloobot) for porting to the A52. This is a continuation on Sloobot's work.

### Installation:
1. Download the module from the releases
2. Open the magisk app and go to modules
3. Click the "Install from storage" button and select the .zip you just downloaded 

> Note: It should only be used on the Galaxy A52 (SM-A526B) running the corresponding Android security patch version as written in the releases. Trying on other devices is at your own risk.<br/>The changes are always reversable, by simply removing the module in Magisk.

### Troubleshooting:
- If camera app crashes (or other issues like error on 64MP mode) please clear camera app data.
- If system apps start crashing, boot into your Recovery and on
